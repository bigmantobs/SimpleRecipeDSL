The file extension reads IdentityDSL as I originally wanted a DSL for creation and printing of Identity Cards but upon attempting to implement it, I realized this is information which can just be kept in a list.
Instead I decided to write a really basic DSL to describe recipes, the idea here is that the user programs recipes into a cooking bot for a competitive online cooking game, wherein you must program your "chefBot" to cook a recipe better and faster than the opponent.
I am not much of a cook myself so the recipe is likely to be flawed. Additionally the DSL is very basic and must be expanded upon with ingredients, cooking techniques, etc.
